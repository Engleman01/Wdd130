      <h3>What you need to know about training your puppy.</h3>
      <p>
        Training your puppy starts on your puppies first night home. Setting expectations from the beginning
      will help you in the long run. Your puppy is going to do puppy things like bite, bark, eat, sleep, and go potty.
      This is going to be an adjustment for you and your new puppy, but when done right everyone is happy.
      Puppy training will go by pretty quickly although when cleaning up some messes it might not seem that way.
      Be patient, build trust with your puppy. Trust will be the foundation of the bond you and your puppy will have. If you
      put in the time and effort to properly train your puppy the reward pays off.
      Puppies need routine just as much as we do. Do your very best to establish a routine and your puppy will learn quickly.
      This transition time is your opportunity to show and teach your puppy how to behave and act. It's important that you teach your
      puppy how to act around you as well as others. Puppies get excited when they meet new people. Teach your puppy early how to act
      around others. Trust is a great foundation that will set you up for success in trainig your new puppy.
      The amount of time per day you spend training is probably not as long as you would think. Know the attention span of your puppy. 
      For instance a 12-week old puppy and a 2 year old dog have two totally different attention spans. A young puppy wont be able to 
      stay focused for more than about 5 minutes. The best way to start out is to do multiple short sessions instead of one long one. 
      Giving you and your puppy a break will help not stress the other out. You will eventually work up to 15 minute sessions with your puppy
      and as he/she continues to grow you will be able to extend the session and get a lot more done. 
      Keep a few things in mind:
        1. Work on 3 to 4 different skills in one longer session.
        2. Everything needs to be layered with obedince.
        3. Start with somthing your dog does well and then switch to other areas.
        4. Always end on a good note so your puppy feels accomplished.      </p>

      <h3>Health of your Puppy</h3>
      <p>
        Some Major Health Concerns of Golden Retrievers
          Subvalvular Aortic Senosis:
            it is a heart disease that is hereditary. It is caused by a narrow connection between
            the left ventricle and the aorta of the affected Goldens' heart
          Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): it is an orthopedic problem in Golden Retrievers. 
          This is caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints.
          Hip Dysplasia: 
            It is a genetic progressive disease. Golden Retrievers with hip dysplasia show refluctance 
            in jumping or running. 
          Hypothyroidism:
            A Golden Retriever with Hypothyroidism produces low thyroid hormones. This problem in 
            Golden Retrievers is curable and treated with medication and a diet.
            
        Golden Retriever  puppies are one of the best family dogs in the world. They are easy to get along 
        with and are a good fit for just about any home and family. They are one of the most loyal dogs. 
        They are devoted to their owners and very intelligent. They will bring you a life of happiness.

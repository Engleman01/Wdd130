                            <p class="tips-and-tricks-2">Training your puppy starts on your puppies first night home.
                                Setting expectations from the beginning
                                will help you in the long run. Your puppy is going to do puppy things like bite, bark,eat,
                                sleep, and go potty.This is going to be an adjustment for you and your new puppy, but when done right
                                everyone is happy. Puppy training will go by pretty quickly although when cleaning up some messes it might
                                not seem that way. Be patient, build trust with your puppy. Trust will be the foundation of the bond you
                                and your puppy will have. If you put in the time and effort to properly train your puppy the reward pays off.
                                Puppies need routine just as much as we do. Do your very best to establish a routine and
                                your puppy will learn quickly. This transition time is your opportunity to show and teach your puppy how to behave and
                                act. It's important that you teach your puppy how to act around you as well as others. Puppies get excited when they meet new
                                people. Teach your puppy early how to act around others. Trust is a great foundation that will set you up for success in trainig
                                your new puppy. The amount of time per day you spend training is probably not as long as you would
                                think. Know the attention span of your puppy. For instance a 12-week old puppy and a 2 year old dog have two totally different
                                attention spans. A young puppy wont be able to
                                stay focused for more than about 5 minutes. The best way to start out is to do multiple
                                short sessions instead of one long one. Giving you and your puppy a break will help not stress the other out. You will
                                eventually work up to 15 minute sessions with your puppy
                                and as he/she continues to grow you will be able to extend the session and get a lot
                                more done.
                                Keep a few things in mind:
                                1. Work on 3 to 4 different skills in one longer session.
                                2. Everything needs to be layered with obedince.
                                3. Start with somthing your dog does well and then switch to other areas.
                                4. Always end on a good note so your puppy feels accomplished.</p>

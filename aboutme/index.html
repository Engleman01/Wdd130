    <h2>Amy Engleman</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, I am very excited to be in this class. A little bit about myself.
       I am married to my wonderful husband Ben and together we have 6 kids (yours, mine and ours). 
       I am orginally from Bountiful Utah but since getting married we have lived in Idaho, North Dakota, Texas
       and now Alabama. Roll Tide!!! (Central standard time)</p>
       <p>Currently I work as an office assistant in a medical office while my husband is attending
        the university to get his doctorate degree. I am pursuing a degree in applied technology and 
        I hope to be able to do great things with it. I enjoy traveling, the beach, watching football, reading, camping and playing games with
        friends and family. I am enjoying learning and growing in my education and I look forward to a great 
        semester with all of you!</p>
